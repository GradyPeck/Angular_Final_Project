    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>The goal of the Open Roads project is to lower the information barriers between citizens and their
        government.
        It can be difficult to comprehend the whole truth of large, complicated systems like the infrastructure
        of an
        entire city. Our hope is that by providing a clear, easily digestable view of the real conditions on the
        ground we can
        overcome bias, facilitate meaningful communication, and foster greater civic engagement.
